##### The experiments in the folder pyfiles_averagelife can be replicated using the numpy files in the folder pds_of_layers_model.
##### The pds_of_layers_model contain the layer by layer persistence diagrams  of different models for 80 data instances closest to the archetypes of the data.
##### The archetypes are computed using SPAM package and are computed over the greyscale of the image. In this experiment we donot require properties of the archetypes thus it is enough to use the nearest sample. A more accurate archetypes can be computed using other packages, which is outside the scope of this work. 
##### The Colab notebook Average_life_and_tau.ipny file is used to demonstrate how to use the py files provided in the folder pyfiles_averagelife. 
##### The Colab notebook for the demonstration of the Archetypes will be updated.
