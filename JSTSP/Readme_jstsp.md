##### The experiments in the folder pyfiles_averagelife can be replicated using the numpy files in the folder layer_persistence_dgm.
##### The layer_persistence_dgm contain the layer by layer persistence diagrams  of different models for 80 data instances closest to the archetypes of the data.
##### The archetypes are computed using SPAM package and are computed over the greyscale of the image. 
##### The colab notebook Average_life_and_tau.ipny file is used to demonstate how to use the py files provided in the folder pyfiles_averagelife.
